        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>During the period the data was collected 90% of the users have tweeted/retweeted up to 10 times. Substantially smaller minority tweeted more than once and the number of users who tweeted an excessive amount of times was comparatively even smaller. Overall this means that on an average each user has tweeted about 1.58 times.</p>
          <p>From the 60 unique users who created 95 tweets with #darbar, 73% have tweeted only once during this time and only 10% of tweeters have created more than 3 tweets. while from the 3,028 unique users who retweeted tweets, 60% of the users have retweeted only ones. Meaning that, on average each user retweeted 2.23 tweets on average.</p>
          <p> These figures give some indication of the overall level of activity and audience participation has not been very active in terms of twitter activity a week after the release of the movie. In total, of the 3,050 unique users who interacted with tweets containing the #DARBAR only 10% posted single tweets, while the rest only retweeted. This suggests that overwhelmingly most users were relatively passive in the conversation.</p>

          <img src="img/wordcloud.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%;">
          <p>Based on the analysis is it clear that most users have been retweeting the posts. However, the total number of accounts which generated the post have been relatively small and they mainly seem to be giving a feedback about the movie, celebrating the boxoffice collections and talking about Rajinikanth the actor. The post also seems to largely be replying @bharatmatrimony and some replies have also been addressed to Rajnikanth haters.</p>
          <p>While not many users in the given data set have self-reported locations most of the data collected is not precise. However, from the information showing the location details we can gather than most tweets are from the southern part of the country as the movie was largely viewed in Tamil. Many tweets were reported to be posted from Tamil Naidu. While on the 17th of January some tweets were also posted from Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Mumbai. There were only very few tweets from the northern part of India. The data set also has collected a few tweets that have been tweeted from other countries such as in USA, UAE, Singapore, Malaysia and Srilanka.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-4" align="center">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Overall, analysing the tweets posted on 17th of January, it is observed that most users have retweeted while there have also been a few tweets generated. In the data set collected tweets have been made mainly by genuine users. Most of the retweets have been created by accounts that seem to by a fan club but haven’t been identified as bots. The accounts managed by the fan clubs have mainly been used to promote the film and send replies to Rajni hater groups. It has been relatively difficult to identify these accounts as mainly because many of them are not using the default profile, have profile pictures set and often have reasonable follower counts.</p>
          <p>With the help of twitter and similar social media platforms, today it has become a lot easier to analysis and understand the response of the larger audience one does not really have to depend on the critic for the review but with the few hashtags and trending words one can easily figure out the reaction of the audience. With the various hashtags not only has it become easier for an individual to get the response of a larger audience but also it helps movie producers and others for the promotions as well.</p>
        </p>Analysing the data based from twitter gives an easy access to a large audience and with the various topics being discussed, Journalists can gather information and use for publishing their stories.</p
